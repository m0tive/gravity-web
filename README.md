# Gravity Web

https://m0tive.github.io/gravity-web/

Gravity Web is a web-based game inspired by the classic Amiga shoot 'em up game. Built using Vite and TypeScript, this game features destructible environments, multiplayer capabilities, and a level editor.

Note. this is being muddled together using GitHub on a mobile + chatgpt, so is not the most elegant project ever conceived.

## Features

- Basic spaceship controls with thrust and gravity
- Static levels with collision detection
- Future support for destructible terrain and multiplayer
